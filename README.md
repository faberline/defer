# Defer

## Brief

Defer is the Cloud Tasks-like delayed push-queue dispatch service in the Axiom
stack.

It owns scheduled execution, HTTP target dispatch, per-queue controls, rate
limits, leases/acks, retries, dead-letter queues, and dedupe keys. It is
intentionally separate from `relay`: Relay is the pull queue for worker-leased
delivery; Defer is the push queue for scheduled HTTP dispatch, where every item
has a target, schedule, attempt policy, and terminal outcome.

Task priority uses the same field shape as relay: an unsigned byte where `0` is
lowest, `255` is highest, and omitted priority defaults to `10`. Defer first
filters tasks by schedule/ETA and queue rate/concurrency limits; priority orders
only the due, dispatch-eligible candidates, with same-priority tasks remaining
FIFO by task creation order.

## Boundaries

- `relay` owns pull-queue broker delivery and opaque worker leases.
- `defer` owns scheduled task lifecycle, target dispatch, retry policy, DLQ, and
  rate/concurrency-limited push dispatch.
- `loom` may use Defer for timers/callbacks, but workflow state remains in Loom.
- `keep` may store large request/response bodies by reference.

Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Runtime: priority-ready set, committed queue-control/rate bucket, fenced lease store, retry scheduler, DLQ state, Raft snapshot/recovery, and bounded HTTP dispatcher.
EC Dimensions: stability: `cargo test -p defer --test task_lifecycle --test rate_limits --test raft_scheduler`; dogfood: `DEFER_SOAK_AUTOSTART=1 bash apps/defer/scripts/soak.sh`; Kubernetes: `bash apps/defer/scripts/kind-e2e.sh`
Required Verification: conformance, dogfood
Promise:
Defer remains stable under sustained scheduled-task load, retries, DLQ writes,
and restart cycles without losing committed tasks or duplicating terminal acks.
The 2026-07-17 default run crossed the 1,024-entry proposal-cache/snapshot
cadence before measuring 60 seconds: 1,043 fixed-state operations, zero errors,
RSS 41,584 -> 42,192 KiB (1%), FD 18 -> 18, threads 12 -> 12, and task-read

Type: Devops
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: HTTP/K8s: queue/task authn/authz, signed target dispatch, tenant isolation, network policy, audit events, secret rotation, and request limits.
EC Dimensions: security: shared audited queue RBAC and credential rotation, HMAC target signing, real peer mTLS, bounded admission, restricted K8s security contexts, read-only secret projection, and NetworkPolicy
Required Verification: negative, conformance
Promise:
Defer protects task control and target dispatch with explicit authorization,
signed delivery, auditability, network policy, and managed secret rotation.

### Competitor Feature Parity

ID: competitor-feature-parity
Type: RuntimeTool
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Docs/Test: delayed HTTP push-task feature matrix against Google Cloud Tasks; Celery and Sidekiq are excluded because they are worker frameworks, not managed HTTP push queues.
EC Dimensions: behavior: schedule, target delivery, terminal success, retry/DLQ, rate/burst/concurrency, cancel/inspect, dedupe/idempotency, and target authentication
Required Verification: conformance
Promise:
Defer keeps an explicit delayed-task feature matrix against established task
dispatch systems, with comparison scope changed only when product requirements change.

### Competitor Performance

ID: competitor-performance
Type: RuntimeTool
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Test: identical single-voter fsync-always durable enqueue -> committed lease -> committed ack workload in Defer and Relay, with throughput, p50/p95/p99, CPU, process RSS, disk bytes, amplification, and error counts.
EC Dimensions: efficiency: `cargo test --release -p defer --test relay_performance_ceiling -- --ignored --nocapture` requires Defer throughput to remain at least 80% of Relay under the declared workload
Required Verification: dogfood
Promise:
Defer bounds the cost of its additional ETA, permit, retry, DLQ, and terminal
state machinery against the sibling Relay work queue. Cloud Tasks remains the
external feature-contract peer; no Cloud performance claim is made without a
real queue, public target, declared region, and equivalent network conditions.

### Delayed Task Lifecycle

ID: delayed-task-lifecycle
Type: RuntimeTool
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Rust/Raft: `DeferScheduler` and `DeferRaft`; HTTP: queue/task single and batch routes, status, cancel, and dispatch.
EC Dimensions: behavior: lifecycle/rate-limit/Raft scheduler tests cover ordering, batch atomicity, cancellation, fenced leases, settlement, failover, and terminal states
Required Verification: smoke, conformance
Promise:
Defer manages delayed task state from creation through terminal success,
failure, cancellation, or dead-letter handoff. Task priority is `u8`
(`0..=255`, default `10`); it is applied only after the task is due and the
queue can dispatch more work.

### HTTP Dispatch And Retries

ID: http-dispatch-and-retries
Type: RuntimeTool
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Rust API: `HttpDispatcher::dispatch_batch`; Raft: committed `LeaseDue` and `SettleBatch`; HTTP: real target method/headers/body/idempotency/signature and manual dispatch route.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `cargo test -p defer --test http_dispatch --test http_api --test rate_limits` - real delivery, signing, retry/DLQ, batch settlement, and lost-ownership fencing
Required Verification: smoke, conformance, negative
Promise:
Defer dispatches tasks to HTTP targets with bounded retries, dedupe keys, and
explicit dead-letter behavior. If a target accepts the effect while the worker
loses its committed fence before settlement, Defer reports `LostOwnership` and
retries with the same idempotency key; only the fenced retry may commit the
terminal outcome.

### Queue Rate Limits

ID: queue-rate-limits
Type: RuntimeTool
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Rust/Raft/HTTP: `QueuePolicy`, committed queue configuration/control, max dispatch per tick/second, burst, max-in-flight, snapshot, and priority among eligible tasks.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `cargo test -p defer --test rate_limits --test task_lifecycle` - per-queue dispatch budget/concurrency/rate enforcement, pause/resume/disable controls, policy update isolation, and priority-preserving dispatch among eligible tasks
Required Verification: smoke, conformance
Promise:
Defer enforces Cloud Tasks-style per-queue controls, rate limits, and
concurrency limits before dispatching tasks to external targets.

Status: confirmed
Surfaces: HTTP: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, queue/task/admin routes.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `cargo test -p defer --test http_api --test cli_contract` - live HTTP/1.1+h2c probes/metrics/OpenAPI, domain routes, offline spec twin, and client generation
Required Verification: smoke, conformance
Promise:
Defer exposes a compact h2c/OpenAPI API list for queue/task lifecycle and
operator workflows.

### Primary Replicas

ID: primary-replicas
Type: Runtime
Root WI: #766
Status: confirmed
Surfaces: Raft: delayed task state machine over `libs/raft-core` and `libs/raft-runtime`.
EC Dimensions: stability: `cargo test -p defer --test raft_scheduler --test raft_peer_mtls` - committed task recovery, same-directory recovered-node catch-up followed by a second leader loss, fencing, snapshots, and authenticated peers
Required Verification: conformance, dogfood
Promise:
Defer replicates task state and timer ownership through raft so failover
preserves scheduled tasks and terminal outcomes. The integration gate restarts
the first failed primary from durable state, waits for task-state convergence,
then removes the current leader and completes another full create/lease/ack
lifecycle through the surviving quorum.

### Stateful Service Workload

ID: stateful-service-workload
Type: Service
Root WI: #2170
Status: auditing
Surfaces: Shared mechanisms: `libs/raft-runtime`, `libs/service-backup`, `libs/service-auth`, and `libs/service-k8s`; Defer integration: Raft-backed scheduler state, admin snapshot backup, queue-scoped authorization, and operator-managed StatefulSet storage.
EC Dimensions: behavior: `aw capability check --project defer --skip-issue-inventory` - the `stateful_storage` profile resolves its common workload baseline; stability and security remain owned by the linked Defer capability roots and their executable gates
Required Verification: conformance
Promise:
Defer composes its stateful production workload from shared Raft, backup,
authorization, and Kubernetes mechanisms while keeping delayed-task lifecycle,
dispatch, rate-limit, failover, and recovery policy in the existing domain roots.
This root is an integration map, not a second implementation of those contracts.
